  question: "Which resource is missed in this Schema?\nServiceRequest -> Appointment -> XXX -> Schedule"
  answer: Slot
  explanation: Slot resources are used to provide time-slots that can be booked using an appointment. They do not provide any information about appointments that are available, just the time, and optionally what the time can be used for. These are effectively spaces of free/busy time.

  question: XXX is a record of a proposal/plan or order for a service to be performed that would result in a Procedure, Observation, DiagnosticReport, ImagingStudy or similar resource.
  answer: ServiceRequest
  options:
  - value: ServiceRequest
  - value: Task
    tip: "In contrast to ServiceRequest, Task which spans both intent and event and tracks the execution through to completion and is intended for \"administrative\" actions like requesting and tracking things to be done to a record, or keeping track of a checklist of steps such to be performed as part of a fulfilment process. A ServiceRequest can be higher-level authorization that triggered the creation of Task, or it can be the \"request\" resource Task is seeking to fulfill."
  - value: CommunicationRequest
    tip: "ServiceRequest and CommunicationRequest are related. A CommunicationRequest is a request to merely disclose information. Whereas a ServiceRequest would be used to request information as part of training or counseling - i.e. when the process will involve verification of the patient's comprehension or an attempt to change the patient's mental state. In some workflows both may exist. For example, upon receiving a CommunicationRequest a practitioner might initiate a ServiceRequest."

  question: |
    A doctor cames to Patient's room,
    He said his parents want to bloom
    His story looks like total fiction,
    Brain problem should be in ...
  answer: Condition
  explanation: A clinical condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern.
  options:
  - value: Composition
    tip: A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement.
  - value: Condition
  - value: PlanDefinition
    tip: This resource allows for the definition of various types of plans as a sharable, consumable, and executable artifact. The resource is general enough to support the description of a broad range of clinical and non-clinical artifacts such as clinical decision support rules, order sets, protocols, and drug quality specifications.
  - value: Subscription 
    tip: The subscription resource is used to define a push-based subscription from a server to another system. Once a subscription is registered with the server, the server checks every resource that is created or updated, and if the resource matches the given criteria, it sends a message on the defined "channel" so that another system can take an appropriate action.

  question: What resource should we use for a payed Claim?
  explanation: The ExplanationOfBenefit (EOB) resource combines key information from a Claim, a ClaimResponse and optional Account information to inform a patient of the goods and services rendered by a provider and the settlement made under the patient's coverage in respect of that Claim. The ExplanationOfBenefit resource may also be used as a resource for data exchange for bulk data analysis, as the resource encompasses Claim, ClaimResponse and Coverage/Eligibility information.
  answer: ExplanationOfBenefit
  options:
  - value: ExplanationOfBenefit
  - value: PaymentNotice
  - value: ClaimResponse

  question: The doctor received an additional specialty and is ready to see new patients. What is the best way to model this?
  answer: Use PractinerRole. One doctor can be in several roles. So he can fulfill his role in different departments of the clinic without conflicts
  options:
  - value: Use PractinerRole. One doctor can be in several roles. So he can fulfill his role in different departments of the clinic without conflicts.
    tip: Great choice! This is the most correct approach.
  - value: Record new services in HealthcareService. The doctor will perform various services and it is convenient to collect reports on him!
    tip: Determining the qualifications of a doctor by services is not the best idea :( He may be able to do something, but not perform at the moment. It's even worse if he performs something without the appropriate qualification!
  - value: Create another Practitioner with new qualifications. It will be convenient to collect statistics for different areas separately.
    tip: Not the best approach :( Duplicating a doctor in different database records will definitely lead to errors!

  question: "We are opening a new clinic. Hooray! How should we begin? First, let's save our services. Where will we record it?"
  answer: "ActivityDefinition. A fairly common name. But it makes sense."
  options:
  - value: Well, everything is clear here. Doctors carry out procedures. This is the Procedure resource.
    tip: Actually no :( We use the Procedure resource to describe a specific doctor's procedure at an appointment, i.e. a specific medical manipulation. This is not suitable for a registry of services.
  - value: HealthcareService. The name explicitly describes the entity.
    tip: You're not alone! Even some production systems fell for it. But let's read the description of the resource carefully. The resource is better suited for service categories. It will come in handy when we group resources.
  - value: ActivityDefinition. A fairly common name. But it makes sense.
    tip: Exactly! The perfect resource for our task! And it will be grouped using HealthcareService.
